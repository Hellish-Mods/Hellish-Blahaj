# Hellish Localization
### A simple solution to your localization problems.

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hellish-Mods/Hellish-Localization/main/src/main/resources/pack.png)

This mod adds various lang files for different mods. We made it because a lot of mods don't have proper localization, especially for 1.16, which many mod developers consider a "dead version".

## This mod currently has support for:

### [Space-BossTools (Beyond Earth)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/beyond-earth)
 * Russian
### [Space-BossTools: Giselle Addon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/space-bosstools-giselle-addon)
 * Russian
